A small machine learning experiment which predicts star ratings for lunch courses based on past user reviews.

JavaScript (React.js) front-end, Python (Flask, Scikit-learn) backend.

Current model is a gradient-boosted regressor. Features used are word tokens from all rated lunch courses, course category & property information and username.
